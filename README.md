# Plant Disease Prediction Using Deep Learning
[_Webapp_](https://suraj4502-ppd.streamlit.app/ "Go to Streamlit app") --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            [_git Repo_](https://github.com/suraj4502/DL_project_Plant_Disease_prediction "Go to GitHub")
- The project aims to develop a system that can accurately identify  various diseases in plants using machine learning algorithms. 
- The system will be trained on a dataset of images of plants affected by different diseases and will use deep learning techniques to extract relevant features from the images. 
- The extracted features will then be used to train a model that can classify new images of plants based on the presence or absence of disease.
- The project will involve the use of deep learning frameworks such as **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and will require the use of image processing techniques such as **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** and **transfer learning**.
- Other technologies that are used to built this project are **React JS**, **Streamlit**,**javascript**, **FastAPI**,**Google Cloud Platforms**. 

- The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a tool that can help farmersand plant pathologists quickly identify and treat plant diseases, leading to higher crop yields and better food security.


## Dataset
The PlantVillage dataset is a collection of over 50,000 high-resolution images of 26 different plant species and 38 different plant diseases, created for advancing computer vision and machine learning techniques for plant disease diagnosis and classification. 

## Model architecture
- This project uses a **transfer learning** approach to tackle our image classification task, leveraging the pre-trained VGG16 model as our base.
- I added my own custom layers on top of the VGG16 architecture to fine-tune the model to my specific problem domain. 
- This allowed me to benefit from the powerful feature extraction capabilities of VGG16 while also tailoring the model to my unique data and classification needs.
- The architecture is as followed :

        1. Resizing layer
        2. VGG16 layers (only Cnn layers)
        3. Flattening layer
        4. A dense layer with 128 neurons and relu function
        5. A dense layer with 64 neurons and relu function
        6. Finally an output layer with Softmax function.
## Results
The Performance of the CNN model is as followed :

## Demo

1. [Streamlit APP](https://suraj4502-ppd.streamlit.app/ "Go to Streamlit app") 

*The [app](https://github.com/suraj4502/Streamlit_app_PDP) is deployed on the Streamlit Cloud while the model is deployed on the GCP as a cloud function, a request is sent every time we want to predict the class of the plant and a response is received from GCP.*
